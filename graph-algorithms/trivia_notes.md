Topics to go through later: 

* The vector, by default, allocates memory on the heap. There is no need to explicitly use a pointer to the vector for this reason.
* __Spanning Tree Protocol__ - The Spanning Tree Protocol is applied for ethernet networks to avoid broadcast radiation - baseically coming up with non-looping paths among nodes to send out broadcast messages, so that these messages to not go around the network in circles and end up floodingthe network. 
* __Disjoint set data structure__ - A Disjoint set data structure keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint subsets. It provides near constant time operations to add new sets and to determine whether elements are in the same set. It finds its application in Kruksal's algorithm for minimum spanning tree formation. Operations on the Disjoint Set Data Structure are as follows:
* __Incremental Connected Components__ - Boost library 
* __Cluster Analysis__ - Clustering is about grouping together similar objects according to some field.
