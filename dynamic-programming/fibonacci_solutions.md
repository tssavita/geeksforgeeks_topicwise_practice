There are multiple ways to extract the n-th Fibonacci number

* A recursive algorithm
* A bottom up or top down algorithm

However at this point, we need to draw attention to the fact that we are not only concerned about improving the time complexity, but we also need to optimize the space complexity. In fact, even if a program takes a lot of time to run it, we may still be able to execute it, but if takes a lot of memory, we may not even be able to run it. Using a caching mechanism to store the value of all the subproblems is not the most efficient way of using space complexity. 

* A bottom up algorithm without caching previous results
* Matrix Exponentiation
* Matrix Exponentiation Optimized
