# Applications of Depth First Search 

1. **Puzzles with a single solution** - Some examples of such puzzles are mazes.
2. **Cycle Detection** - Finding if there is a cycle in unweighted graphs.
3. **Topological Sort** - A classical algorithm to solve the problem of dependencies. Some applications of topological sort itself are smart compilation of projects, heirarchical distribution, 
4. **Strongly Connected Components** - Decomposing a graph into strongly connected components. 
4. **Reachability** - Checking if a node is reachable from a particular source node in the graph.
5. **Graph Bipartite** - Checking if a graph is bipartite or not. This is also possible through breadth first search.
