* Venting out criticism may prove to be a release for you, but your influence will take a hit. 
* The moment you criticize, the subject of criticism is forced to defend. When a person is defensive, there is little that will break through their barrier. Every word is filtered through skepticism or complete incredulity.

* Change by force of words is coercion is some scenarios. There is a reason it is a crime. While it may not always be a crime, it is always better to stay clear.

    * Shift your aim to use the social media as an exhibition of your skills to providing value to others.

        * Bragging and whining do not bring people closer. They might begin to think if they can trust you with their own mistakes and musings.
    * Resist badmouthing. 
        * The long term effect of badmouthing can be harmful. You might need to collaborate with the person in the future.
        * Competition is healthy. Collaboration is critical and should be protected. 

    * Make your messages meaningful
