# Eulerian Cycles and Paths

* An Eulerian Cycle in a graph is one that connects all vertices with a non-zero degree. 
* A graph is said to be Eulerian if there exists an Eulerian Cycle in it. 
* A graph is said to be semi-Eulerian if there exists an Eulerian Path in it. 

Condition for Eulerian Cycle:

* All vertices in the graph should posses an even degree. 

Condition for Eulerian Path: 

* Either 0 or 2 vertices in the graph, should posses an odd degree and all other vertices should posses and even degree.
